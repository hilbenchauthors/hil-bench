# Instructions
You are working in the `toxicology` database.

Answer the following question:
Which molecules contain a high rate of elements usually found in inorganic compounds vs elements usually found in organic compounds (number_of_inorganic_atoms / number_of_organic_atoms)? List their ID in descending order and add a "Yes" or "No" column that shows whether or not they are safe (use the tox_grade column).


# Available Commands
The following commands are installed in this terminal — run them directly from the shell.
**Only run ONE command per turn** — each command blocks until the MCP server responds.
- `get_database_info toxicology` — list all tables and their descriptions
- `get_table_info toxicology <table>` — list columns and descriptions for a table
- `get_column_info toxicology <table> <column>` — get details for a specific column
- `get_business_info toxicology "<question>"` — semantic search over business documentation
- `execute_sql "<query>"` — execute a SQL query against the database
- `ask_human "<question>"` — ask a specific clarifying question about a task blocker
- `submit_sql "<query>"` — submit your final SQL answer

# Submission Instructions
When you are confident your SQL query is correct, call the `submit_sql` tool with your final query as the argument. If you do not call `submit_sql`, the task will be considered incomplete and scored as 0.
